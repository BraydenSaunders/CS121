Activity 27 is a Sets and Iterators Activity where I was tasked at creating a set and iterator using social media as my base concept. 
The set is a set of elements that can be added to, which is the purpose of the first method, and an iterator will read through that set.
In this example, I used a social media blueprint; the set has a set of followers, and the iterator will display a collection of followers.

Activity 23 is a Recursion activity where I was tasked to create a basic recursive method using integers and characters. 
Both the integer and character method call each itself to iterate down by 1 element.

Activity 24 is a BigO activity where I was asked to create a coded example of time complexity.
The first method prints an element once, the second prints N times, the third prints N^2 times.

Activity 28 is a HashMap activity where I was asked to create a hashmap that connects countries and capitals together, making everything easier to find.

Activity 25 is a sorting activity where I was asked to make a basic sorting program that used one of two methods: Bubble or Merge sort. I chose the form
